# Michael Kuegeler in a nutshell

***IT-Consultant, IT-Architect, Artist, Passionate Reader***

## About Me

I live in Munich and have many years of experience as a solution architect and consultant in software application projects on a national and international level. My focus is on requirements engineering and design of cloud architectures, software as a service (SaaS), business to business (B2B), and business to consumer (B2C) integration scenarios.

My industry experience includes telecommunications, construction, information technology, retail, finance, and the public sector. 

I have had the opportunity to share my knowledge as a lecturer and speaker at trade shows, customer workshops, and webcasts.

I consider myself a computer enthusiast who enjoys learning new technologies, programming languages, developing new ideas from them.

As an avid reader of scientific, historical, and philosophical literature, and an occasional producer of essays and digital art, I am always open to new thoughts and insights.
